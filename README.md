# JIACRA IV Code Repository

## Overview

This repository contains code and synthetic anonymised data for the Fourth Joint Inter-Agency Report on Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance Analysis (JIACRA IV). The report focuses on the integrated analysis of antimicrobial consumption and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from humans and food-producing animals in the EU/EEA.

## Introduction

The JIACRA IV report aims to provide insights into antimicrobial consumption and resistance patterns in bacteria from humans and food-producing animals. This `README.md` file serves as a guide for users to understand and replicate the analyses performed in the report.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders corresponding to each type of analysis:

-   **Univariate analysis**

-   **Multivariate analysis**

-   **Trend analysis**

## Installation

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the respective folders to access the scripts and documentation for each analysis type.
3.  Follow the instructions in each `README.md` file in each folder.
4.  Open the corresponding `.Rproj` file in each folder.

## Code

Detailed R scripts for each analysis type and SAS code for the trends analysis are available. These scripts are annotated for better understanding.

## Data

The anonymised synthetic datasets for demonstration of the code and their corresponding structure can be found in each data subfolder.

## Documentation

For detailed instructions and documentation for each analysis type, please refer to the `README.md` files in their corresponding subfolder.
